# TrenchHUD
TF2 Frontline! HUD
 
 TrenchHUD, currently in development, is a World War I and II themed Heads Up Display for Team Fortress 2 that is being made for the Frontline! Community Project, and out of personal interest.

This HUD's goal is to be a good representation of the Frontline! Update and go along with the general theme with the project. TrenchHUD will be designed like a HUD of old First Person Shooters. 

Any feedback, bug reports, and general discussions about the HUD are accepted in this group, but off topic things that are not directed towards me or questions about the HUD will probably be removed by admins.

Well, what are you waiting for soldier! The wonderful world of war is waiting for you ( just a joke, chill) Get in the trenches and fight!
